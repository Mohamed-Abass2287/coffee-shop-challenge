# coffee-shop-challenge-phase3
In this repo i am working with a Coffee shop-style domain. We have three models: Coffee, Customer, and Order. For our purposes, a Coffee has many Orders, a Customer has many Orders, and an Order belongs to a Customer and to a Coffee. Coffee - Customer is a many-to-many relationship
